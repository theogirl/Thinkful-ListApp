Qs for Blanche - List App

- understand "this" (refers to the object on which the currently executing method has been invoked... why not just write it out explicitly?)

- understand .append(), .prepend(), .val(), .on()

- want to be able to edit the already-input text

- reminder callback function = ? (second part of an execution?)

- list of most commonly used jQ functions? (cheat sheet)

-jQ "normalizes" something??

- concept/terminology review:
  argument, handler, function, variable, routine, method





In real app scenario, wouldn't this be controlled more with DBs? E.g. remove an item from the list = remove from db? Need to remember all users lists and items, therefore store in DB?

Also, need way to prevent entry of malicious text in the form input field! (how to strip/escape?)
